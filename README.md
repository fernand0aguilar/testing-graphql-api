## Test Plan
A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and resources required to perform testing for a software product.

The test plan serves as a blueprint to conduct software testing activities as a defined process.

As per ISTQB definition: 
> “Test Plan is A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities.” 

**Making this document has multiple benefits**
1. Help people outside the test team such as developers, business managers, customers understand the details of testing. 
1. It guides our thinking.
1. Important aspects like test estimation, test scope and strategy are documented, so it can be reviewed by ManagementTeam and re-used for other projects.

We are going to follow the steps below to create a test plan as per IEEE 829

1. Analyze the product
1. Design the Test Strategy 
1. Define the Test Objectives 
1. Define Test Criteria 
1. Resource Planning 
1. Plan Test Environment  
1. Determine Test Deliverables


# 1 Analyze the product

**Business Background**
* Who will use the API software?
* What is it used for?
* How will it work? What is the happy path?
* What are technologies the product uses?

> Your team is developing a GRAPHQL API that will work as the back end side for a CRM tool that is being developed by a different team. The API is only accessible by a registered user by providing an authentication mechanism.

## 2 Test Strategy
### 2.1 Scope
**Inclusions** - The components of the system to be tested
* Functional API testing
    * Read only
    * Read and Write
* Security authentication
* Development / Production environment

**Exclusions** - The components of the system that will not be tested
* The frontend user interface
* Non-functional testing

### 2.2 Testing Type
* API integration testing
* Security testing
* Automated testing
    * Schema
    * Query
    * Mutations
    * Resolvers

### 2.3 Risk and Issues

* Strengths
    * Resources, communication, disposition, previous knowledge
* Weakness
    * Unfamiliarity with using C# for automated API testing
* Opportunities
    * Technical opportunity to learn with real world demands
* Threats
    * The project fail or delay 
    * The solution not being sufficient

## 3 Test Objectives
Test Objective is the overall goal of the test execution.
* The objective here is to implement an automated QA and testing process to test the graphql API
* The objective of the testing is finding as many software defects as possible; 
* It should identify bugs according to the acceptance criteria.
* Formally report the found bugs
* Ensure that the software under test is bug free both in development and production environment

## 4 Test Criteria
The acceptance criteria that the API must meet are the following:

* A user can:
    * List all customers in the database
    * Get full customer information, including a photo URL
    * Create a new customer:
        * A customer should have (an asterisk indicates that it is a required field):
            * name, (required)
            * surname (required)
            * id (autogenerated), (required)
            * photoUrl,
            * userId (required)
        * Image uploads should be able to be managed.
        * The customer should have a reference to the user who created it
    * Update an existing customer.
        * The customer should hold a reference to the last user who modified it.
    * Delete an existing customer
* An Admin can also:
    * Manage users:
        * Create Users
        * Delete users.
        * Update users.
        * List users.
        * Change admin status.

## 5 Architecture
* ASP.NET Core Library 
* ASP.NET Core Runtime / .NET SDK
* StrawBerryShake GraphQL Client
* Testing Framework - nUnit or xUnit or other
* Continuous Integration pipeline

## 6 Assumptions
Types of Bugs that API testing detects
* Fails to handle error conditions gracefully  
* Missing or duplicate functionality 
* Reliability Issues. Difficulty in connecting and getting a response from API. 
* Security Issues 
* Improper errors/warning to a caller 
* Incorrect handling of valid argument values 
* Response Data is not structured correctly
